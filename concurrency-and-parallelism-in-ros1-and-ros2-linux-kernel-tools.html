  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>This is the second (and last) article in a series that tries to give developers
the right knowledge to tackle performance (especially latency) problems with
ROS. The <a href="//nicolovaligi.com/concurrency-and-parallelism-in-ros1-and-ros2-application-apis.html">first
article</a>
covered the journey from the ROS API to Linux threads. This article will
complete the quest by introducing how these threads are mapped to Linux threads.</p>
<p><em>This article is partially based on my presentation at ROSCon 2019.</em></p>
<h2>The toolbox</h2>
<p>As we've seen in the previous article, the ROS API offers <code>CallbackQueue</code>s and
<code>Spinner</code>s to control how specific callbacks and topics are mapped onto OS
threads. The next step is to control how these threads are mapped to CPU cores.
That's the job of the OS scheduler, which keeps a list of active threads
waiting for CPU time, and multiplexes them on invidual CPU cores.</p>
<p>Since resuming, swapping, or pausing a thread incurs quite a bit of latency,
the choices made by the OS scheduler have a big impact on the overall
performance of the system. The best option is just to avoid the problem
altogether. As long the stack doesn't spawn more threads than there are CPU
cores, the job of the scheduler is easy. Since <em>one thread = one CPU core</em>,
application-level APIs (eg. spinners) are enough to give the developer full
control over the CPU.</p>
<p>However, I've never seen a ROS stack that manages to achieve this goal. In ROS
1, even the simplest C++ node spawns at least 5 threads. Granted, most of them
are IO-bound (for example waiting on network sockets), but that's still quite a
lot of threads for the kernel to manage. This means that we'll need to introduce
OS-level tools to control how threads are mapped onto CPU cores.</p>
<p>The next sections will introduce the 4 most commonly used tools to achieve this
goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>thread priorities</li>
<li>the deadline scheduler</li>
<li>a kernel with real-time (<code>PREEMPT_RT</code>) patches</li>
<li>CPU affinities and <code>cpuset</code>s</li>
</ul>
<h2>Thread priorities</h2>
<p>Assigning thread priorities is the most intuitive and widely known tool to
control scheduling. Threads with higher priority <em>tend to</em> get more CPU time
over time (we'll see more about this later). Priorities can be set with the
<code>nice</code> command line tool or the <code>setpriority(2)</code> syscall.</p>
<p>While priorities are useful for workstations and servers, they're not sufficient
for robotics applications. The default scheduling algorithm in Linux
(<code>SCHED_OTHER</code>) is based on time-sharing, and therefore allows a low
priority thread to steal CPU time away from an higher priority one as long
as the overall allocation of CPU time is consistent with the priorities.</p>
<p>This is obviously undesiderable in Robotics systems, where high-priority
operations are often critical for safety. Luckily, Linux offers other scheduling
policies that offer more control to the developer.</p>
<h2>The deadline scheduler</h2>
<p>The deadline scheduler (<code>SCHED_DEADLINE</code>) is an alternative scheduler that
individual threads can opt in to. Deadline-scheduled threads inform the kernel
that they require <code>n</code> microseconds of CPU time every time period of <code>m</code>
milliseconds. After running a schedulability check to ensure that all
deadline-scheduled threads can co-exist on the machine, the scheduler
guarantees that each task will receive its time slice. Deadline scheduled tasks
have priority over all others in the system, and are guaranteed not to
interfere with each other (ie, they're preempted when they exceed their time
allocation).</p>
<p>For reference, it's actually fairly straightfoward for a task to opt in to the
deadline scheduling class. Here, the task declares that it needs 10
milliseconds of CPU time every 30 milliseconds. Depending on the system
configuration, these calls might need root-level permissions.</p>

<h2>Real-time capable kernel</h2>
<p><code>SCHED_DEADLINE</code> is an improvement over the deadline scheduler in terms of
latency, but there's still a problem. The kernel itself is still allowed to
interrupt user tasks when it needs to run housekeeping chores and service
syscalls. As shown in the following figure (from <sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>), this means that user
tasks can suffer from unbounded latency (purple line) when the kernel suspends
them to complete long-running tasks in kernel mode.</p>
<p><img alt="Latency distribution with RT and non RT kernels" src="//nicolovaligi.com/rt-kernel.png"/></p>
<p>This issue is somehow alleviated by the <code>PREEMPT_RT</code> set of patches to the Linux
kernel (green line in the figure). By making more kernel operations
interruptible and scheduling them alongside user tasks, these changes provide an
upper bound for latency (the tails of the latency distribution die off). A
<code>PREEMPT_RT</code> kernel trades these improved latency guarantees for a decrease in
throughput because of the increased synchronization overhead.</p>
<h2>CPU core affinity and cpusets</h2>
<p>The previous 3 sections covered tools to control how the OS scheduler decides
which tasks to select for execution at any given time. On a multicore CPU (which
is most of the CPUs today, even on robots), the missing piece of the puzzle is
choosing which of the CPU cores should execute a certain task. This decision can
have a big impact on performance because modern CPUs rely strongly on large
caches for performance. Swapping a task from one core to another invalidates
these caches and therefore makes code run substantially lower.</p>
<p>The <code>sched_setaffinity</code> family of syscalls and the <code>cpuset</code> machinery in the
kernel are the two main knobs that can be used to tweak the allocation
heuristics in the kernel. Besides an increase in throughput, this also helps
limit interference between different components of the stack.</p>
<h1>Wrapping up</h1>
<p>This completes the journey from the ROS interface down to execution on CPU
cores. The <a href="//nicolovaligi.com/concurrency-and-parallelism-in-ros1-and-ros2-application-apis.html">first
article</a>
covered ROS-level APIs to control how subscriptions are mapped onto Linux
threads. This article took it all the way to the hardware by presenting the most
important knobs in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>While our coverage of these extensive topics could never be extensive, hopefully
these pointers will be a good starting point for Roboticists struggling with
performance issues on their robots.</p>
